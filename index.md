Welcome to the GitHub site for scripts, templates and other resources supporting the SANS Institute's six-day course '[SEC505: Securing Windows and PowerShell Automation](https://sans.org/sec505)'. 

All scripts written by me, [@JasonFossen](https://twitter.com/jasonfossen) of [Enclave Consulting LLC](http://www.enclaveconsulting.com), are in the public domain.

Most scripts are code snippets for teaching purposes, but others are ready to be adapted to your Active Directory network.  Hope you find them useful!

See you at SANS!
